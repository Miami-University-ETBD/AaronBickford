    <h1>Edwin Martinelli</h1>
    <p>
      Edwin Martinelli was an engineer and robotics expert who played a key role in the development of animatronic entertainment. Born in 1948, in the high streets of Chicago, he grew up with a fascination for artificial intelligence and mechanical automation. His work in robotics led him to develop an advanced AI known as "The Mimic," which allowed for animatronic behavior to learn and replicate human actions or be programed to act a certian way.
