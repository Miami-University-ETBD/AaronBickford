      <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">William B. Afton</span></h2>
      <p>
        William B. Afton was born on <em>June 15, 1945</em>, and grew up in Hurricane, Utah. From an early age, he showed an interest in engineering and entertainment, which later influenced his career in the family entertainment and restaurant industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        William made friends with Edwin Martinelli, a fellow innovator who shared his new prototype for a mascot called a <b>Mimic</b>. Together, they explored new ways to bring joy and wonder to families through entertainment and explored the reality with this new mimic technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a strong entrepreneurial spirit, William co-founded a successful restaurant chain that combined delicious dining experiences with cutting-edge animatronic performances. His vision was to create a place where families could gather, celebrate, and enjoy immersive storytelling through advanced robotics.

      <h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Edwin Martinelli</span></h2>
      <p>
        Edwin Martinelli was an engineer and robotics expert who played a key role in the development of animatronic entertainment. Born in <em>1948</em>, in the high streets of Chicago, he grew up with a fascination for artificial intelligence and mechanical automation. His work in robotics led him to develop an advanced AI known as <b>"The Mimic"</b>, which allowed for animatronic behavior to learn and replicate human actions or be programmed to act a certain way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the late 1970s, Edwin partnered with William Afton to co-found an entertainment company that brought animatronic and family fun together. They introduced a new generation of mascots that combined advanced AI with captivating performances. Their creations became the foundation of a family-friendly restaurant experience that entertained visitors and led to the companyâ€™s success.
